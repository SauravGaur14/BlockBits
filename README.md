**BitBlocks**  
A fully functional blockchain and cryptocurrency simulation that allows users to create transactions, mine blocks, and track their balance.  
This project demonstrates core blockchain principles such as proof-of-work, transaction validation, and mining rewards.  
Built using React for the user interface and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for securing transactions.  
  
**Features**  
**Single Wallet System:** Generate and manage transactions from a single wallet.  
**Mining Blocks:** Validate pending transactions by mining new blocks and earn mining rewards.  
**Transaction History:** View detailed transaction history and balances in real-time.  
**Proof-of-Work Mechanism:** Implements difficulty-based mining to secure the blockchain.  
**Elliptic Curve Cryptography:** Ensures secure transactions using ECC.  
**Technologies Used**  
**React:** For building the UI and managing state.  
**Elliptic:** For implementing elliptic curve cryptography.  
**Tailwind CSS:** For responsive, utility-first styling.
